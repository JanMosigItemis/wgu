# RED PHASE - Test Plan

## Test Concept
Create a test for the "toggle all" functionality using the 'a' key:
- **Scenario**: `interactiveSelect` is initialized with items (all selected by default).
- **Action**: User presses 'a', then confirms validation (Enter/y).
- **Expected Result**: The selection should be cleared, returning an empty list of items.

## Core Development Principles (Red Phase)
- **Write a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality**
