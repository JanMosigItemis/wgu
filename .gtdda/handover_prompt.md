# RED PHASE - Test Plan

## Test Concept
Create a test for confirm functionality:
- **Scenario**: `interactiveSelect` is initialized with items.
- **Action**: User presses 'enter' (key name `return` or `enter`).
- **Expected Result**: This should be treated same as 'y' - confirms the selection and returns the selected items.

## Core Development Principles (Red Phase)
- **Write a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality**
